# Backpropagation
Training a neural network to draw a curve by implementing backpropagation by the chain rule to calculate Jacobians of the cost function.

The neural network will then be trained using a (pre-implemented) stochastic steepest descent method, and will draw a series of curves to show the progress of the training.
